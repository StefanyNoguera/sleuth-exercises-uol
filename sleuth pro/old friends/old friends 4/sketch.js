Case 502 - A donation - stage 4

This final document will seal the deal. C’mon kid, let’s send these crooks down.

- Run the sketch and you'll see the redacted text on the left and the missing words on the right
- Your task is to replace the redacted sections in redactedText with the missing words.
- You must do this by finding each word in the data structures  below and then concatenating redactedText with references to the word in the respective data structure.
