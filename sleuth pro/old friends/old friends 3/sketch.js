Case 502 - Out of the picture - stage 3

Yet another document has come my way. This one is even more tricky to decipher.
The Governor must really have something to hide.

- Run the sketch and you'll see the redacted text on the left and the missing words on the right
- Your task is to replace the redacted sections in redactedText with the missing words.
- You must do this by finding each word in the data structures  below and then concatenating redactedText with references to the word in the respective data structure.
