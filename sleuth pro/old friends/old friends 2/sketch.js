Case 502 - A delicate matter - stage 2

We’re hot on the trail kid, and another document has come my way. This message is a little more tricky to decipher, but I know you can do it.

- Run the sketch and you'll see the redacted text on the left and the missing words on the right
- Your task is to replace the redacted sections in redactedText with the missing words.
- You must do this by finding each word in the data structures  below and then concatenating redactedText with references to the word in the respective data structure.
